# Motif-Mark

Motif Mark is an objectâ€‘oriented Python tool designed to visualize motifs on biological sequences using pycairo, producing to-scale PNG images that clearly annotate sequence features such as exons, introns, and overlapping motifs. This project:

* Parses FASTA and motif files
* Dynamically resolves ambiguous bases
* Renders customizable visualizations with legends and color-coding

making it an ideal tool for researchers and bioinformatics enthusiasts. For detailed planning and design insights, please refer to my [OoCA Motif-Mark Plan](OoCA_Motif-mark.md).
